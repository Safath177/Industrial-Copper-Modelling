# **Copper Price & Business Status Prediction**

## **Overview**  
This project leverages machine learning to analyze a copper dataset, applying classification and regression models to predict business status and selling price. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to ensure accurate predictions.

## **Dataset**  
The dataset consists of relevant features influencing copper pricing and business status. It was cleaned and preprocessed to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and prepare it for ML model training.

## **Machine Learning Models**  
- **Extra Trees Classification**: Predicts business status (`Yes/No`) based on historical and market data.  
- **Random Forest Regression**: Estimates the selling price of copper using various market factors.

## **Workflow**  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Feature selection  
   - Normalization & encoding  
2. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Extra Trees Classification for business status  
   - Random Forest Regression for price prediction  
   - Performance evaluation using accuracy, RMSE, etc.  

## **Requirements**  
* pandas as pd
* warnings
* warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
* from datetime  datetime, timedelta
* numpy as np
* from sklearn.preprocessing  OrdinalEncoder
* matplotlib.pyplot as plt
* plotly as px
* seaborn as sns
* openpyxl

## **Usage**  
Run the script using:  
streamlit

## **Results**  
- Achieved high accuracy in classification  
- Regression model effectively predicts market price fluctuations
